      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I have a bachelor degree in Biology, from San Marcos National University in Peru,
        with mention in Zoology (Ornithology).</p>
      <p>After a few years studying ecology and ethology of different species of birds,
        mainly parrots and raptors from the Coast and Amazon rainforest of Peru,
        I moved to Argentina where I found my other passion in life: <em>coding</em>.</p>
      <p>I worked as a freelancer since the early years of web development, coding web templates for different clients with just HTML/CSS.
      Over time I added JavaScript to my skill set, expanding my chances of being able to work on more complex projects.</p>
      <p>Always in constant training, now in React, Node and another technologies that allow me to create robust applications that solve real problems.
      One of the projects I'm working on now involves programming and how it contributes to bird conservation.</p>
      <p>Father of a lovely and smart daughter of five years, with whom I spend part of my free time watching nature tv shows and cartoons.</p>
